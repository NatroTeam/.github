# Credits

Apart from the [Natro Team](https://github.com/NatroTeam), contributions from many individuals helped to make [Natro Macro](https://github.com/NatroTeam/NatroMacro) what it is today.<br>
This file is made to mention and thank these people!
> [!NOTE]  
> If you think you deserve to be on this list, feel free to reach out to any member of [Natro Team](https://github.com/NatroTeam) privately!

## Inspirations

Without these people, Natro Macro probably wouldn't exist!
- [Onett][onett-link], the developer of [Bee Swarm Simulator][bss-link], inspired us by creating a beloved game that has given us all hundreds of hours of enjoyment. Unlike most game developers, Onett allows the use of macros and has even praised us [on a few occasions][onettflex-link]!
- [@Lexikos](https://github.com/Lexikos), and all other contributors of [AutoHotkey][ahk-link], for creating and maintaining the scripting language that Natro Macro is made in!
- [zez][zez-link], the creator of Zez Macro, which was the first publicly released AutoHotkey GUI macro for Bee Swarm Simulator. Early versions of this project had code derived from Zez Macro, and as such, he was added as an honorary member of the [Natro Team](https://github.com/NatroTeam).

## Special Mentions

Thank you to all of these people, Natro Macro would not be the same without you!
 - Everyone with the Gumdrop Gang role in our [Discord server][discord-link]: these people put their time into helping around in the server so that we, as developers, have more time to develop the macro!
 - All of our Macro Testers, Macro Helpers, Mods, and Admins.
 - A very special person who built our [Discord server][discord-link] from the ground up and created all of our foundations.<br>R.I.P. SuperDadof6, you will always be cherished. ‚ù§
